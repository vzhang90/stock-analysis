# **Stock Analysis Refactor VBA**
Performing analysis on stock data in the excel file [VBA_Challenge](https://github.com/vzhang90/stock-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge.xlsm) with VBA to automate values using refactoring code.

## Overview of VBA Challenge
Steve has recently graduated with his finance degree and taking on his parents as his first clients. While his parents want to invest all their money into DAQO New Energy Corporation, a company that makes silicon wafers for solar panels, Steven this his parents' investments should be more diversified. So, he wants to analyze several green energy stocks in the excel file [VBA_Challenge](https://github.com/vzhang90/stock-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge.xlsm) using VBA. 

The purpose of this module is to better understand the process of refactoring (or editing) different codes to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information across multiple macros. 
 
## Results

As datasets become larger, it is important to know how fast the VBA code will compile results.

To help Steve, there is a VBA script to caculate how long the code takes to execulte and output the elapsed time in a message box.

When running the macro for 2017, the message box pops up with the Elapsed Time for 2017

The Elapsed Time for 2018 is shown in the displayed message box when running the macro for 2018

## Summary
advantages and disadavntages of refactoring code in general
When refactoring code, there is not necessarily newly added functionality. The biggest benefit to refactoring code is making it more efficient by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read.
